# images/

Place PNG images here with the exact filenames listed in `image_mapping.json` to override the remote assets.

If you want me to download the remote images for you, run the script `scripts/fetch_remote_images.py` which will fetch the listed files into this directory.

Filenames expected (examples):
- `339a4d82-ee12-486b-88a9-b91986561cec.png`
- `20d5416c-7f9d-403f-8101-d21624b60bb0.png`

If you replace an image, keep the filename identical and reload `index.readonly.html` in your browser.
